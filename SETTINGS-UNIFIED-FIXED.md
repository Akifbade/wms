# ✅ COMPANY & BRANDING SETTINGS - UNIFIED & FIXED

## 🎯 Problem Identified:

### **DUPLICATE COMPONENTS** causing conflicts:
1. **CompanySettings.tsx** - Saving: name, email, phone, address, website, logo
2. **BrandingSettings.tsx** - Saving: name, logo, colors, showCompanyName

**Both were calling `/api/company` PUT endpoint and overwriting each other's data!**

---

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. **Unified into ONE Component**
   - Merged both components into **CompanySettings.tsx**
   - All fields now saved together in ONE request
   - No more conflicts or data loss

### 2. **Single Settings Page**
   - Changed "Company Information" + "Branding & Appearance" → **"Company & Branding"**
   - One page, all settings, no duplicates

### 3. **All Fields Included:**
   #### Basic Information:
   - ✅ Company Name
   - ✅ Email
   - ✅ Phone
   - ✅ Website
   - ✅ Address

   #### Branding:
   - ✅ Company Logo (upload with preview)
   - ✅ Primary Color
   - ✅ Secondary Color  
   - ✅ Accent Color
   - ✅ Show Company Name toggle
   - ✅ 4 Color Presets (Indigo Purple, Blue Cyan, Green, Amber Red)
   - ✅ Live Preview

### 4. **Single Save Button**
   - Saves ALL fields at once
   - Prevents partial updates
   - No more overwriting data

## 🗂️ Files Changed:

- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx` - Removed duplicate nav item
