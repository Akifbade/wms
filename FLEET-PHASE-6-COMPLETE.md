## API Endpoints Used

All endpoints from **Phase 4** (already working):

### Trips
- `GET /api/fleet/trips?status=ONGOING` - Get active trip
- `POST /api/fleet/trips` - Start new trip
- `PATCH /api/fleet/trips/:id` - End trip
- `POST /api/fleet/trips/:id/track` - Log GPS point

### Vehicles
- `GET /api/fleet/vehicles` - List assigned vehicles

### Drivers
- `GET /api/fleet/drivers/me` - Current driver info

---

## How to Use

### Desktop Testing
```bash
# Frontend already running on http://localhost:3000
# Backend already running on http://localhost:5000

# Access Driver PWA:
http://localhost:3000/driver
```

### Mobile Testing
```bash
# Find your local IP
ipconfig

# Access from mobile (same WiFi):
http://192.168.x.x:3000/driver

# Install PWA:
# Chrome → Menu → "Add to Home Screen"
# Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen"
```

### Login Credentials
```
Email: admin@demo.com
Password: admin123
```

## User Flow

### Starting a Trip

1. Open `/driver` on mobile
2. Tap "Start Trip" button
3. Select vehicle from dropdown
4. (Optional) Enter job reference
5. (Optional) Enter starting odometer
6. Tap "Start Trip"
7. **GPS location auto-captured**
8. Trip starts, timer begins

### During Trip

- **Live tracking**: GPS logs every 30 seconds
- **Duration**: Real-time timer
- **Speed**: Current speed in km/h
- **Location**: Lat/Lon with accuracy
- **Offline**: Works without internet, syncs later

### Ending a Trip

## Technical Details

### PWA Manifest
```json
{
  "name": "Fleet Driver App",
  "short_name": "Fleet",
  "start_url": "/driver",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#1e40af",
  "background_color": "#1e40af"
}
```

### Service Worker
- **Cache Strategy**: Network first, fallback to cache
- **API Requests**: Network only (with offline response)
- **Static Assets**: Cached on install
- **Background Sync**: GPS logs queued offline

### GPS Tracking
- **Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Accuracy**: High (uses GPS)
- **Battery**: Optimized (only during active trip)
- **Offline**: Queued in localStorage
- **Sync**: Auto-sync when connection restored

### State Management
- **Active Trip**: React state
- **GPS Tracking**: Custom hook with refs
- **Offline Queue**: localStorage
- **Authentication**: JWT in localStorage

## What's NOT Implemented (Future)

### Deferred to Later Phases
- ⏳ Fuel logging screen
- ⏳ Trip history list
- ⏳ Trip details with map
- ⏳ Driver profile with stats
- ⏳ Camera integration (receipt photos)
- ⏳ Push notifications
- ⏳ IndexedDB (using localStorage for now)
- ⏳ Map view with route polyline

### Why MVP First?
- ✅ Core trip tracking working
- ✅ GPS logging functional
- ✅ Offline support active
- ✅ Can test on real mobile device
