# ✅ Scanner Fix Complete - Test Data Created

## 🎯 Problem Identified & Fixed

### Issue 1: Rack Map Not Showing
**Root Cause**: API returns `{ racks: [...] }` but frontend expected direct array

**Fix Applied** (Scanner.tsx line 278-295):
```typescript
const data = await response.json();
// Backend returns { racks: [...] }
const racksArray = data.racks || data || [];
setRacks(Array.isArray(racksArray) ? racksArray : []);
```

### Issue 2: No Pending Shipments
**Root Cause**: No shipments with `status = 'PENDING'` existed in database

**Fix Applied**: Created test data script that adds:
- 67 racks (already existed)
- 2 new PENDING shipments

## 📊 Current Database State
