## ✅ FIXED: No More Confusion!

### BEFORE (2 Modals - Confusing):

## 🔍 Button Not Visible? Here's Why:

### Debug Added to VPS:

**Open Browser Console (F12) on VPS and look for:**
```javascript
📦 Shipments loaded: [
  { id: "WHM364764971", status: "???", boxes: 19 }
]
```

**What's the status value?** That's the issue!

### Button Shows For:
- ✅ IN_STORAGE
- ✅ PARTIAL  
- ✅ ACTIVE
- ✅ IN STORAGE (with space)

### Button Hidden For:
- ❌ PENDING (correct - can't release yet)
- ❌ RELEASED (correct - already released)
- ❌ Other values (need to add)
