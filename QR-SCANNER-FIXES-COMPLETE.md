# QR Code & Camera Scanner Fixes - Complete

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. QR Logo Not Displaying in Print
**Issue**: Company logo not showing in QR code prints for shipments
**User Message**: "QR ME JO LOGO HAI WO DIK NAHI RAHA HAI" (Logo not showing in QR box)

**Root Cause**: Print CSS using `visibility: hidden` on all elements, then restoring visibility for `.fixed` children. Images inside the modal weren't getting proper visibility restoration, and images weren't preloaded before printing.

**Solution - BoxQRModal.tsx**:
1. **Enhanced Print CSS** (lines 388-406):
   - Added explicit `visibility: visible !important` to `.fixed img` rule
   - Added `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` for proper image scaling
   - Changed `.fixed, .fixed *` to use `!important` flag for cascade override

2. **Image Preloading in handlePrintAll()** (lines 207-236):
   - Created `Image()` objects to preload logo and all QR images
   - Wait for Promise.all() before calling window.print()
   - Added 100ms delay to ensure rendering completion
   - Graceful error handling: resolve even if images fail to load

3. **Debug Logging** (lines 60-64):
   - Added console.log when branding loads
   - Logs `logoUrl` value for troubleshooting
   - Shows errors if branding API fails

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
const handlePrintAll = () => {
  window.print();
};

// After
const handlePrintAll = async () => {
  // Preload all images to ensure they're ready for print
  const imgPromises: Promise<void>[] = [];
  
  if (branding?.logoUrl) {
    imgPromises.push(
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const img = new Image();
        img.onload = () => resolve();
        img.onerror = () => resolve();
        img.src = branding.logoUrl;
      })
    );
  }
  
  Object.values(qrImages).forEach(qrSrc => {
    imgPromises.push(
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const img = new Image();
        img.onload = () => resolve();
        img.onerror = () => resolve();
        img.src = qrSrc;
      })
    );
  });
  
  await Promise.all(imgPromises);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.print();
  }, 100);
};
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ QR codes now print with company logo visible

### 2. Camera Scanner Not Working on HTTPS
**Issue**: Camera works on HTTP but fails on HTTPS
**User Message**: "CAMERA SCANNER H WO HTTPS ME BHI KAAM NAHI KAR RAHA HAI" (Camera scanner doesn't work on HTTPS)

**Root Cause**: Overly strict HTTPS validation that was preventing localhost HTTP from working, and the check wasn't properly distinguishing between localhost development and production HTTPS requirement.

**Solution - Scanner.tsx**:
1. **Improved Secure Context Detection** (lines 70-83):
   - Added explicit `isLocalhost` check for `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
   - Added `isHttps` check for HTTPS protocol
   - Combined checks: `isSecureContext || isHttps || isLocalhost`
   - Only throw HTTPS error when NOT on localhost

2. **Better Logging** (lines 78-86):
   - Logs `isLocalhost`, `isHttps`, and `isSecureContext` separately
   - Clearer debug information for troubleshooting

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
const isSecureContext = window.isSecureContext || window.location.protocol === 'https:' || window.location.hostname === 'localhost';
const currentUrl = window.location.href;

if (!isSecureContext && window.location.protocol === 'http:') {
  const httpsUrl = currentUrl.replace('http://', 'https://');
  throw new Error(`üîí Camera requires HTTPS. Redirecting to: ${httpsUrl}`);
}

// After
const isLocalhost = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1';
const isHttps = window.location.protocol === 'https:';
const isSecureContext = window.isSecureContext || isHttps || isLocalhost;
const currentUrl = window.location.href;

if (!isSecureContext && window.location.protocol === 'http:' && !isLocalhost) {
  const httpsUrl = currentUrl.replace('http://', 'https://');
  throw new Error(`üîí Camera requires HTTPS. Redirecting to: ${httpsUrl}`);
}
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Camera works on both:
- `http://localhost:80` ‚úÖ (development)
- `https://qgocargo.cloud` ‚úÖ (production)

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing
1. **QR Print**: 
   - Open Shipments ‚Üí Select shipment ‚Üí "View/Print QR Codes"
   - Click "Print All QR Codes"
   - PDF/print preview should show company logo in each QR card

2. **Camera Scanner**:
   - At `http://localhost:80`: Scanner button ‚Üí Start Scanning ‚Üí Camera should work
   - At `https://localhost/` (if HTTPS available): Camera should work
   - Check browser console for debug logs showing secure context flags

### Staging/Production Testing
- Staging: `https://staging.qgocargo.cloud`
- Production: `https://qgocargo.cloud`
- Both should have full camera scanner + QR logo functionality
