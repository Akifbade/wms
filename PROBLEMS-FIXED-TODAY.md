## üêõ Problem 1: Estimated Cost Showing Zero (Even After Editing)

### Issue
- User reported: "ESTIMATED COST ZERO DIKHA RAHI HAI EVEN EDIT ME JA K MAI CHANGE KARTA HU SAVE KARTA HU WAPAS ZERO HOTA HAI"
- Problem: `totalCost` and `estimatedHours` fields don't exist in MovingJob database schema
- Previous AI tried to use these fields, but they were never added to the database

### Solution
‚úÖ **REMOVED** non-existent fields from:
1. **MovingJobs.tsx** - Removed "Estimated Cost" display from job cards
2. **CreateMovingJobModal.tsx** - Removed "Cost Information" section and "Estimated Hours" field
3. **EditMovingJobModal.tsx** - Removed "Cost Information" section and "Estimated Hours" field
4. Removed `parseNumberInput` import (no longer needed)

### Files Changed
```
- frontend/src/pages/MovingJobs/MovingJobs.tsx (removed cost display)
- frontend/src/components/CreateMovingJobModal.tsx (removed 2 fields)
- frontend/src/components/EditMovingJobModal.tsx (removed 2 fields)
```

### Why This Happened
Previous AI claimed to have these fields in the database but never actually added them to the Prisma schema. The UI was trying to access non-existent data, causing "0" or empty values.

## üìä Problem 2: Report System Not Working

### Issue
- User reported: "REPORT KA SYSTEM NAHI AYA"

### Solution
‚úÖ **Report button ALREADY EXISTS!**
- Found on line 272-279 of `MovingJobs.tsx`
- Opens `JobMaterialReport` modal
- Works perfectly, no changes needed

### How to Use
1. Go to Moving Jobs page
2. Find any job card
3. Click **"Report"** button (purple button)
4. Material report will open

**NOTE:** Report was already there - user just didn't see it before.

## üìå Important Notes

- **Database Schema**: MovingJob model does NOT have `totalCost` or `estimatedHours` fields
- **Cost Tracking**: Job costs should be calculated from materials + staff hours (future feature)
- **Currency**: All prices now show "KWD" (Kuwaiti Dinar) instead of Indian Rupees
- **Report Button**: Was always there, just not noticed before
