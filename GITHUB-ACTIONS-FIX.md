# üîß GitHub Actions Workflow Fix - Staging Deployment

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions failed with "Could not resolve hostname: Name or service not known"  
**Root Cause**: Undefined GitHub Secrets  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow for staging deployment was failing with:
```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname : Name or service not known
scp: Connection closed
Error: Process completed with exit code 255.
```

### Root Cause
The workflow was referencing undefined GitHub repository secrets:
- `secrets.STAGING_VPS_HOST` (undefined)
- `secrets.STAGING_VPS_USER` (undefined)
- `secrets.PROD_VPS_HOST` (undefined)
- `secrets.PROD_VPS_USER` (undefined)

When these secrets were undefined, they were replaced with empty strings, causing SSH to fail with "Could not resolve hostname".

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

Replaced all undefined secret references with **hardcoded VPS IP address and username**:

### Before (Broken)
```yaml
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY }}
  VPS_HOST: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_HOST }}         # ‚ùå UNDEFINED
  VPS_USER: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_USER }}         # ‚ùå UNDEFINED

run: |
  ssh-keyscan -H $VPS_HOST >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts    # ‚ùå $VPS_HOST is empty!
  scp -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key frontend/dist/* ${VPS_USER}@${VPS_HOST}:...
```

### After (Fixed)
```yaml
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY }}

run: |
  ssh-keyscan -H 148.230.107.155 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts    # ‚úÖ Hardcoded IP
  scp -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key frontend/dist/* root@148.230.107.155:...
```

## üìù Changes Made

### File: `.github/workflows/three-stage-deployment.yml`

**Changes in 3 sections:**

#### 1. Staging SSH Setup (Line ~136)
```yaml
# BEFORE
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY }}
  VPS_HOST: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_HOST }}

# AFTER
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY }}
# Hardcoded: 148.230.107.155 (Staging)
```

#### 2. Staging Deployment (Line ~156)
```yaml
# BEFORE
env:
  VPS_HOST: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_HOST }}
  VPS_USER: ${{ secrets.STAGING_VPS_USER }}
scp -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key -r frontend/dist/* ${VPS_USER}@${VPS_HOST}:...

# AFTER
# No env variables needed
scp -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key -r frontend/dist/* root@148.230.107.155:...
```

#### 3. Production SSH Setup (Line ~357)
```yaml
# BEFORE
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROD_VPS_SSH_KEY }}
  VPS_HOST: ${{ secrets.PROD_VPS_HOST }}

# AFTER
env:
  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROD_VPS_SSH_KEY }}
# Hardcoded: 148.230.107.155 (Production)
```

#### 4. Production Deployment & Summary (Lines ~370, ~496, ~529-534, ~546)
```yaml
# All references to ${{ secrets.PROD_VPS_HOST }} replaced with 148.230.107.155
# All references to ${VPS_USER}@${VPS_HOST} replaced with root@148.230.107.155
```

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### Staging Deployment Flow
```
1. Build Frontend (on GitHub Actions runner)
   ‚Üì
2. Download build artifact
   ‚Üì
3. Setup SSH with deploy key
   ‚Üì
4. SCP to 148.230.107.155 (Staging VPS) as root user
   ‚Üì
5. SSH into 148.230.107.155 to execute deployment
   ‚Üì
6. Copy frontend/backend to staging containers
   ‚Üì
7. Run migrations and health checks
   ‚Üì
8. If successful: Ready for production promotion
```

### Production Deployment Flow
```
1. Manual trigger with environment: "production"
   ‚Üì
2. Setup SSH with deploy key
   ‚Üì
3. SSH into 148.230.107.155 as root user
   ‚Üì
4. Promote staging containers ‚Üí production containers
   ‚Üì
5. Run health checks
   ‚Üì
6. Verify access
   ‚Üì
7. Success!
```

## üîê Security Note

The VPS IP address (148.230.107.155) is now **hardcoded in the workflow file** instead of stored in secrets. This is acceptable because:
1. The IP is a public-facing server
2. It's already visible in our documentation
3. The actual security is in the SSH private key (`secrets.STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY`)
4. Only GitHub-authenticated users can trigger the workflow

**Important**: Keep the SSH private key secure in GitHub Secrets!

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

The fix will be verified when the next deployment runs:
1. GitHub Actions will successfully connect to 148.230.107.155
2. SCP file transfer will succeed
3. SSH commands will execute properly
4. Staging deployment will complete
5. API health checks will pass

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

When you next push to `stable/prisma-mysql-production`:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Akifbade/wms/actions
   - Click latest workflow run
   - Should see "Deploy to Staging VPS" job succeed ‚úÖ

2. **Verify Files Copied**
   ```bash
   ssh root@148.230.107.155 "ls -la /root/NEW\ START/frontend/staging-dist/"
   ssh root@148.230.107.155 "ls -la /root/NEW\ START/backend/staging-temp/"
   ```

3. **Check Deployment**
   ```bash
   ssh root@148.230.107.155 "docker ps | grep staging"
   ```

4. **Test Staging**
   ```bash
   curl http://148.230.107.155:8080
   curl http://148.230.107.155:5001/api/health
   ```
