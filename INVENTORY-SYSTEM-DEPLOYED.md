# ✅ Inventory Management System - Deployment Complete

## Summary
Successfully added a complete inventory management system to the WMS backend running on VPS at `148.230.107.155`.

## What Was Deployed

### 1. **Database Tables** ✅ (Already created in previous session)
- `rack_consumables` - Track stock of consumables (boxes, tape, bubble wrap, etc.) at each rack
- `consumable_movements` - Audit trail of all stock transfers between racks
- `consumable_disposals` - Track disposal of items (used/damaged/expired/waste)
- `consumable_sales` - Record sales of old material with pricing and revenue tracking
- `inventory_configurations` - Per-company settings for item types, units, and thresholds

### 2. **Backend API Routes** ✅ (Just deployed)

#### Consumables Route (`/api/consumables`)
**File:** `/var/www/wms/backend/src/routes/consumables.ts` (233 lines)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /company/all` - List all consumables for logged-in company
- `GET /rack/:rackId` - Get consumables for specific rack
- `POST /` - Add new consumable to rack (requires ADMIN/MANAGER)
- `POST /transfer/stock` - Move consumables between racks (requires ADMIN/MANAGER)
- `POST /dispose/item` - Mark consumables as used/damaged/expired/waste (requires ADMIN/MANAGER)
- `POST /sell/material` - Sell old material and reduce stock (requires ADMIN/MANAGER)
- `GET /sales/report/:companyId` - Get all sales and total revenue

**Authentication:** JWT token required, role-based access control

#### Inventory Config Route (`/api/inventory-config`)
**File:** `/var/www/wms/backend/src/routes/inventory-config.ts` (77 lines)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /:companyId` - Get company's inventory configuration
- `POST /` - Create new inventory config (requires ADMIN)
- `PUT /:companyId` - Update existing config (requires ADMIN)

**Configuration includes:**
- Array of item types (e.g., "Boxes", "Tape", "Bubble Wrap")
- Array of units (e.g., "pcs", "roll", "box")
- Low stock threshold for alerts

### 3. **Main Server Integration** ✅
**File:** `/var/www/wms/backend/src/index.ts` (Updated)

Added route registrations:
```typescript
import consumablesRoutes from './routes/consumables';
import inventoryConfigRoutes from './routes/inventory-config';

// ...

app.use('/api/consumables', consumablesRoutes);
app.use('/api/inventory-config', inventoryConfigRoutes);
```

- **Backend Service:** Running (PM2 process wms-backend, PID 363857)
- **Memory Usage:** 268.4MB
- **Uptime:** Just restarted
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:5000/api/health ✅

## Deployment Method
1. ✅ Created route files locally in VS Code workspace

5. ✅ Committed to git (commit: 60b54ff7)

## Git Commit
```
commit 60b54ff7
Author: admin@wms.local
Date: Today

    Add consumables and inventory config API routes
    
    - Created consumables.ts with 7 API endpoints for stock management
    - Created inventory-config.ts with 3 endpoints for company settings
    - Registered both routes in main index.ts
    - TypeScript builds successfully
    - All database tables ready
```

## Testing Endpoints
To test the new API, use:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://148.230.107.155:5000/api/health

# Get all consumables (requires JWT token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://148.230.107.155:5000/api/consumables/company/all

# Add consumable
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rackId": "rack-123",
    "itemType": "Boxes",
    "quantity": 100,
    "unit": "pcs",
    "minThreshold": 20
  }' \
  http://148.230.107.155:5000/api/consumables

# Transfer stock
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fromRackId": "rack-123",
    "toRackId": "rack-456",
    "itemType": "Boxes",
    "quantity": 50,
    "unit": "pcs",
    "reason": "Restocking secondary warehouse"
  }' \
  http://148.230.107.155:5000/api/consumables/transfer/stock
```

## Next Steps

### Frontend Implementation (Not yet started)
1. Create React pages at `/var/www/wms/frontend/src/pages/Inventory/`
   - Stock tab - View consumables by rack
   - Transfers tab - Move stock between racks
   - Disposal tab - Mark items as waste
   - Sales tab - Sell old material
   - Settings tab - Configure item types and thresholds

2. Create Reports pages at `/var/www/wms/frontend/src/pages/Reports/`
   - Shipment inventory report
   - Consumable stock status
   - Sales revenue report

### Optional: Reports API (Can be added later)
- Planned for `/api/reports` endpoint
- Will provide shipment inventory, storage charges, and consumable reports
- Not yet implemented due to complexity - can be added when needed
