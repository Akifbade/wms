### 4. **Authentication & Authorization**

- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN, MANAGER, WORKER)
- ✅ Multi-tenant scoping via companyId
- ✅ Extended Express Request type with user context
- ✅ Middleware-based authorization

## 📊 Key Features Implemented

### Business Logic
1. **Cost Calculation**
   - Materials cost: Sum of all material issues for a job
   - Labor cost: Hourly rate × hours worked (from job assignments)
   - Damage loss: Quantity × unit cost of damaged items
   - Profit = Revenue - Total Costs
   - Profit margin = (Profit / Revenue) × 100%

2. **Material Workflow**
   - Record purchase batches with unit costs
   - Allocate to jobs (tracks cost per allocation)
   - Return tracking with good/damaged split
   - Auto-restock good materials to warehouse racks
   - Approval workflow for damages and premium materials

3. **Financial Reporting**
   - Per-job cost snapshots
   - Company-wide profitability dashboard
   - Cost breakdown by category (materials, labor, damage)
   - Material cost analysis by job

4. **Plugin System**
   - Install/activate/deactivate workflow
   - Full audit logging with timestamps
   - Plugin status tracking
   - Uninstall with history preservation

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **API**: RESTful with JSON
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based authorization
- **Styling**: Inline CSS (no external CSS framework dependency)
