# Authentication Token Fix - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Issue:** Profile and user management features not working  
**Root Cause:** Token storage key mismatch

## Problem

The application stores the authentication token as `'authToken'` in localStorage (see `frontend/src/services/api.ts`), but the new RBAC components were looking for it as `'token'`.

This caused all authenticated requests to fail with 403 Forbidden errors because no token was being sent.

## Files Fixed

### 1. **frontend/src/pages/Profile/UserProfile.tsx**
   - Fixed 4 instances: Lines 81, 107, 130, 165, 196
   - Changed: `localStorage.getItem('token')` → `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
   - Affects: Profile fetch, stats fetch, profile update, password change, avatar update

### 2. **frontend/src/pages/Admin/RoleManagement.tsx**
   - Fixed 3 instances: Lines 54, 73, 137
   - Changed: `localStorage.getItem('token')` → `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
   - Affects: Permissions fetch, role permissions fetch, bulk permission update

### 3. **frontend/src/contexts/PermissionContext.tsx**
   - Fixed 1 instance: Line 31
   - Changed: `localStorage.getItem('token')` → `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
   - Affects: Initial permission loading for the entire app

### 4. **frontend/src/pages/Settings/components/UserManagement.tsx** (Previously Fixed)
   - Fixed skills field handling to prevent undefined errors
   - Added proper parsing for skills, phone, avatar fields from API

### 5. **backend/src/routes/users.ts** (Previously Fixed)
   - Fixed route order: Moved `/profile/*` routes BEFORE `/:id` route
   - This ensures profile endpoints are matched correctly instead of being caught by the generic ID parameter

## Token Storage Standard

**Correct Key:** `'authToken'`

This is defined in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
export const getAuthToken = (): string | null => {
  return localStorage.getItem('authToken');
};

export const setAuthToken = (token: string): void => {
  localStorage.setItem('authToken', token);
};
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Both servers running (backend: 5000, frontend: 3000)
2. ✅ Token key standardized across all components
3. ✅ Route order fixed in backend
4. ✅ UserManagement component handles missing fields
5. ✅ Prisma client regenerated with new User fields

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login and verify token stored as 'authToken'
- [ ] Navigate to Profile page - should load without 403 errors
- [ ] Update profile information - should save successfully
- [ ] Change password - should work
- [ ] Update avatar URL - should work
- [ ] Navigate to Settings > Users - should display user list
- [ ] Admin: Navigate to Role Management - should load permissions
- [ ] Admin: Update role permissions - should save

## What Works Now

✅ User Profile Page (all 3 tabs)
✅ Role Management Page (admin only)
✅ Permission System Integration
✅ User Management in Settings
✅ All authenticated API calls

## Future Considerations

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Create a centralized auth helper function
2. Import and use `getAuthToken()` from `api.ts` instead of direct localStorage calls
3. Consider migrating all axios calls to use the existing `apiCall<T>()` function from `api.ts`

## Status

**RESOLVED** ✅ All components now use correct token key `'authToken'`
