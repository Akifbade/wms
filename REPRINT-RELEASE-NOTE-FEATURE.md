## 🐛 ERROR FIX

### Issue: Old Shipment Error
```
Error: No boxes available to release
Shipment ID: cmgpg89zn002c7cm0lt7q5d9d
```

**Cause:** This is an OLD shipment created before box creation logic was added.

**Solution:**
1. Don't try to release this shipment
2. Use fresh shipments only
3. For testing, use: `cmgpfx99f00217cm0otpeud11`

### Fresh Test Shipment:
```
ID: cmgpfx99f00217cm0otpeud11
Name: Release Test User
Boxes: 4
Status: Can be released
```

  releasedBy: "Admin User",        // ⚠️ Generic
