# Clear Browser Cache and Service Workers

## The issue you're seeing is caused by:
1. **Browser cache** - Old Fleet code is cached in your browser
2. **Service Worker** - PWA service worker is caching old routes
3. **Manifest** - PWA manifest was still configured for Fleet app

## âœ… What I Fixed:
1. Updated `manifest.json` - Changed from "Fleet Driver App" to "Warehouse Management System"
2. Updated `sw.js` - Removed Fleet-specific caching
3. Removed all Fleet components and routes

## ðŸ”§ How to Fix in Your Browser:

### Option 1: Unregister Service Worker (Recommended)
1. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000/
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
4. Click **Service Workers** in the left sidebar
5. Click **Unregister** next to any service workers
6. Click **Clear storage** and check all boxes
7. Click **Clear site data**
8. Close DevTools and **hard refresh** with `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Option 2: Clear Cache Manually
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select:
   - âœ… Cached images and files
   - âœ… Cookies and site data
   - âœ… Hosted app data
3. Time range: **All time**
4. Click **Clear data**
5. Close and reopen browser
6. Go to http://localhost:3000/

### Option 3: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open an **Incognito window** (Ctrl + Shift + N)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/
3. This will load fresh code without cache

### Option 4: Different Browser
Try opening the app in a different browser (Edge, Firefox, etc.) that hasn't cached the old code.

## ðŸš€ After Clearing Cache:

You should see:
- âœ… No Fleet menu items
- âœ… No "/api/fleet" errors
- âœ… Clean navigation (Dashboard, Shipments, Racks, etc.)
- âœ… Error Recorder with red debug banner at top

## Still Having Issues?

If you still see Fleet errors after clearing cache, run this in the browser console (F12):
```javascript
// Unregister all service workers
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
  for(let registration of registrations) {
    registration.unregister();
    console.log('Unregistered:', registration);
  }
});

// Clear all caches
caches.keys().then(function(names) {
  for (let name of names) {
    caches.delete(name);
    console.log('Deleted cache:', name);
  }
});

// Reload
window.location.reload(true);
```

Then hard refresh with `Ctrl + Shift + R`.

**The Fleet system is completely removed from the codebase. The errors you're seeing are just cached browser data!**
