# âœ… VERSION TRACKING SYSTEM ADDED

## What Changed
I've added version tracking numbers to the Scanner page to help you see when data is FRESH and NOT CACHED.

## Where to See Version Numbers

### 1. **Main Scan Result Header** - v1, v2, v3...
   - Shows a blue-purple badge with `v{number}` at top right
   - **Increments each time you scan a new QR code**
   - Example: `v1` â†’ `v2` â†’ `v3`

### 2. **Rack Information Badge** - RACK-v1, RACK-v2...
   - Shows when you scan a rack QR code
   - Located at top-right of rack info box

### 3. **Shipment Information Badge** - SHIPMENT-v1, SHIPMENT-v2...
   - Shows when you scan a shipment QR code  
   - Located at top-right of shipment info box

### 4. **Pallet Information Badge** - PALLET-v1, PALLET-v2...
   - Shows when you scan a pallet QR code
   - Located at top-right of pallet info box

### 5. **Pending Shipments List Header** - Data v1, v2, v3...
   - Shows at top-right of the Pending Shipments tab
   - **Increments each time you refresh/reload pending shipments**
   - Also shows last refresh time (HH:MM:SS)

   - Select "All time" and clear cache
   - OR press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)

2. **Refresh the page** â†’ You should see `Data v1` in Pending Shipments

3. **Scan a QR code** â†’ You should see the version badge increment (v1 â†’ v2)

4. **Refresh pending shipments** â†’ Data version increments

5. **Scan another code** â†’ Scan version increments
