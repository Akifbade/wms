## ⚡ CRITICAL: ONE-TIME SETUP

Copy-paste this exact command on VPS:

```bash
# SSH to VPS:
ssh root@148.230.107.155

# Run this (COPY ENTIRE BLOCK):
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /root/backup-manager.sh quick >> /root/backups/cron.log 2>&1"; echo "0 2 * * * /root/backup-manager.sh full >> /root/backups/cron.log 2>&1"; echo "0 3 * * 0 /root/backup-manager.sh list >> /root/backups/verify.log 2>&1") | crontab -
