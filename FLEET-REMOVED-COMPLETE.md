   - Reload the page

2. **Hard Refresh**:
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` to force reload

   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these messages:
     - "ErrorRecorder component is being executed"
     - "üî¥ ErrorRecorder mounted!"
     - "DEBUG: Error Recorder component is mounted!"

4. **Check DOM**:
   - Press F12
   - Go to Elements tab

   - If found, the component is rendering

## How to Test Your System

1. **Login**: http://localhost:3000/login
2. **Try Core Features**:
   - Create a new shipment
   - Scan a QR code
   - View dashboard
   - Check invoices
   - Add expenses

3. **Verify No Fleet Errors**:
   - Navigate through all pages
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors
   - All features should work smoothly

## Files Backed Up

- `backend/prisma/schema-backup.prisma` (contains Fleet models if you need to restore)

## If You Need Fleet Back

If you need to restore the Fleet system in the future, you can:
1. Restore the Prisma schema from `schema-backup.prisma`
2. Uncomment the Fleet module in `backend/src/index.ts`
3. Restore the Fleet pages from git history or backups

## Next Steps

Your system is now clean and running without any Fleet-related code. The Error Recorder should be visible with a bright red debug banner at the top saying "DEBUG: Error Recorder component is mounted!"

If it's still not showing, please:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl + F5)
2. Check the browser console for any errors
3. Let me know what you see in the console
