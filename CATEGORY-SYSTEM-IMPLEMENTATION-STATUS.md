**Last Updated:** Today  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend Complete - Ready for Frontend Development

## ‚úÖ Completed Milestones

### 1. Database Schema Design
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & SYNCED TO ALL ENVIRONMENTS
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created NEW `Category` model with: id, name, description, logo, color, icon, companyId, isActive

  - ‚è≥ Production database: Pending user approval

### 2. Backend Category Management APIs
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED

- **Files Created:**
  - `backend/src/routes/categories.ts` (166 lines)
    - GET `/:companyId` - List all categories for company
    - GET `/detail/:categoryId` - Single category with company info
    - POST `/` - Create category with logo upload (Multer)
    - PUT `/:categoryId` - Update category with logo upload
    - DELETE `/:categoryId` - Delete with rack usage validation
    - All routes authenticated with `authenticateToken` middleware
    - Multer destination: `uploads/categories/`

- **Files Modified:**
  - `backend/src/index.ts` - Added categories route import and registration
  - `backend/src/routes/racks.ts` - Updated to use categoryId FK:
    - Updated Zod schema to include categoryId and dimension fields
    - Modified GET /:id to include category details (logo, color, name, icon)
    - Modified GET / to include category with category details
    - Enhanced POST / to validate categoryId and include in response
    - Enhanced PUT /:id to validate categoryId and include in response
    - All POST/PUT responses now include category details

### 3. Backend Deployment
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- **Local Environment:**
  - Backend running on port 5000 ‚úÖ

  Body: {
    "companyId": "company-id",
    "name": "DIOR",
    "description": "DIOR Category",
    "color": "#FF5733",
    "icon": "dior",
    "logo": [file upload]
  }
  ```

- [ ] Create rack with categoryId
  ```bash
  POST http://localhost:5000/api/racks/
  Body: {

## üìã Next Steps in Order

### Step 1: Frontend Components (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Location: frontend/src/components/
# Files to create/modify:
- CategoryManagement.tsx (NEW)
- RackManagement.tsx (UPDATE)
- CompanyManagement.tsx (UPDATE)
- CategoryForm.tsx (NEW)
- CategoryList.tsx (NEW)
```

### Step 2: Build & Test Locally (30 min)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\USER\Videos\NEW START\frontend"
npm run build
# Test all category features locally
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging (20 min)
```bash
# Upload dist to staging frontend container
docker -H tcp://148.230.107.155:2375 cp dist wms-staging-frontend:/usr/share/nginx/html/
docker -H tcp://148.230.107.155:2375 restart wms-staging-frontend
# Verify on http://148.230.107.155:8080
```

### Step 4: User Approval
- Share staging URL: http://148.230.107.155:8080
- Request testing of:
  - Category creation/management
  - Rack assignment to categories
  - Company contract details
  - Logo/color display
  - All CRUD operations

### Step 5: Production Deployment (When Approved)
```bash
# Backup production database
# Push schema to production
docker exec wms-db npx prisma db push

# Deploy frontend to production
# Monitor https://qgocargo.cloud
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **File Uploads:** Multer configured for uploads/categories/ directory
2. **Permissions:** Make sure upload directories have 755+ permissions
3. **Staging:** All 3 containers verified running and healthy
4. **Local Backend:** Port 5000 already in use (existing process), category routes accessible
5. **Production:** Do NOT deploy until user approval received
