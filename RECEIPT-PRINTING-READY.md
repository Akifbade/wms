### **File 1: `PaymentBeforeReleaseModal.tsx`**

**Added receipt printing function:**
```typescript
const printReleaseReceipt = (withdrawalResponse: any) => {
  const receiptData = {
    withdrawal: withdrawalResponse.withdrawal || withdrawalResponse,
    shipment: shipment,
    invoice: invoice,
    payment: paymentOption !== 'debt' ? {
      amount: paymentData.amount,
      method: paymentData.paymentMethod,
      transactionRef: paymentData.transactionRef,
      receiptNumber: paymentData.receiptNumber,
    } : null,
    releaseDate: new Date(),
    releaseType: withdrawalResponse.withdrawal?.remainingBoxCount === 0 ? 'FULL' : 'PARTIAL',
    boxesReleased: withdrawalData.withdrawnBoxCount,
    boxesRemaining: withdrawalResponse.withdrawal?.remainingBoxCount || 0,
  };

  sessionStorage.setItem('releaseReceipt', JSON.stringify(receiptData));
  window.open('/release-receipt', '_blank');
};
```

**Modified payment submit to call print:**
```typescript
// After successful payment
const withdrawalResponse = await processWithdrawal();

// Print receipt
printReleaseReceipt(withdrawalResponse);
```
