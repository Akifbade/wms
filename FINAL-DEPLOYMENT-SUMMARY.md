🎯 ZERO CONFLICTS - All ports unique
```

### ✅ Disk Space
```
Before: 90% (CRITICAL) → Freed 20GB
After: 32% (HEALTHY)
Available: 33GB (plenty of headroom)
```

## 🔐 SECURITY & ISOLATION

### Network Level
✅ Production and Staging on separate Docker networks
✅ Cannot route traffic between environments
✅ Docker bridge isolation prevents cross-environment access

### Database Level
✅ Separate MySQL instances (different ports: 3307 vs 3308)
✅ Different database names (warehouse_wms vs warehouse_wms_staging)
✅ Different credentials (separate users and passwords)

### Application Level
✅ Different environment variables
✅ Different JWT secrets
✅ Different API ports (5000 vs 5001)

### Frontend Level
✅ Different ports (80 vs 8080)
✅ Different API endpoints in configuration
