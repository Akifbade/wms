## 🎨 UI Features for Workers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No racks found"
**Check**:
1. Open console (F12)
2. Look for: `"Loaded racks: []"`
3. Click "Refresh" button in rack map
4. If still empty: Create racks in Dashboard

**Solution**: 
```
Go to Dashboard → Racks → Add Rack
Create at least 3 test racks
Come back to scanner → Manual Entry
Click Refresh → Should show racks
```

### "No Pending Shipments"
**Check**:
1. Console shows: `"Loaded shipments: { shipments: [] }"`
2. No shipments with status PENDING exist

**Solution**:
```
Go to Dashboard → Shipments → New Shipment
Set Status = PENDING
Total Boxes = 5
Save
Come back to scanner → Pending List
Click Refresh → Should show shipment
```

### Rack map loads but empty
**Debug Info Shown**:
```
"Debug: racks = []"
```
This means API returned empty array - no racks in database.

### Shipment won't load
**Check Console**:
```
"Error loading shipment: 404"
```
Shipment ID might be wrong or deleted.
