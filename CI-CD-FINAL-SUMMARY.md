## 🚀 The 3-Stage Pipeline

```
STAGE 1: LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
├─ Developer creates feature branch
├─ Makes changes locally
├─ Tests with docker compose
└─ Pushes to GitHub

STAGE 2: STAGING (VPS)
├─ PR created to develop branch
├─ GitHub Actions runs tests & builds
├─ Auto-deploys to staging.qgocargo.cloud
├─ Team tests features
└─ If OK → PR to main

STAGE 3: PRODUCTION (VPS)
├─ PR created to main branch
├─ Manual approval required
├─ GitHub Actions runs tests & builds
├─ Auto-deploys to qgocargo.cloud
├─ Health checks verify
└─ Live for customers!
```

## 🔑 Setup Required From You

### IMMEDIATE (Do This First!)

**[ ] 1. Read Documentation**
- [ ] Read: `CI-CD-DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` (5 min)
- [ ] Read: `CI-CD-COMPLETE-SETUP.md` (10 min)
- [ ] Review: `CI-CD-ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md` (15 min)

**[ ] 2. Follow Setup Checklist**
- [ ] Open: `GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Do: Step 1 - Add GitHub Secrets (10 min)
- [ ] Do: Step 2 - Branch Protection (5 min)
- [ ] Do: Step 3 - Commit Workflow Files (5 min)
- [ ] Do: Step 4 - Verify SSH (10 min)
- [ ] Do: Step 5 - Test Pipeline (20 min)
- [ ] Do: Step 6 - Test Rollback (10 min)

**Time to Setup:** ~30-40 minutes

---

## ✅ Detailed Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets (10 min)

**Go to:** GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

**Add These 8 Secrets:**

```
STAGING_VPS_HOST       = your-vps-ip
STAGING_VPS_USER       = staging-user
STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY    = (your SSH private key)
STAGING_VPS_PORT       = 22

PROD_VPS_HOST          = your-vps-ip
PROD_VPS_USER          = root
PROD_VPS_SSH_KEY       = (your SSH private key)
PROD_VPS_PORT          = 22

(Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK          = (your Slack webhook)
```

**How to get SSH key:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# Copy the entire output
# Paste into STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY and PROD_VPS_SSH_KEY
```

### Step 2: Setup Branch Protection (5 min)

**Go to:** GitHub Repo → Settings → Branches → Add Rule

**For `main` branch:**
- Require pull request before merging
- Require 1 approval
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches up to date

**For `staging` branch:**
- Require status checks to pass

**For `develop` branch:**
- Require status checks to pass

### Step 3: Commit Workflow Files (5 min)

```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git add scripts/
git add CI-CD-*.md
git add QUICK-DEPLOYMENT-REFERENCE.md
git add GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin develop
```

### Step 4: Verify SSH Access (10 min)

```bash
# Test SSH to staging
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa staging@148.230.107.155 "echo OK"

# Test SSH to production
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@148.230.107.155 "echo OK"
```

Both should output: `OK`

### Step 5: Test Pipeline (20 min)

```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b test/pipeline

# Make tiny change
echo "# test" >> README.md

# Push
git add .
git commit -m "test: ci/cd"
git push origin test/pipeline

# Go to GitHub:
# - Create PR: test/pipeline → develop
# - Wait 15 minutes for tests
# - Check Actions tab for status
# - Should see: test-build ✅ build-images ✅
```

### Step 6: Test Rollback (10 min)

```bash
# SSH to staging
ssh staging@148.230.107.155

# List backups
ls -lh /root/NEW\ START/backups/

# Verify can access
docker compose logs -n 5 backend
```
