## 🎯 Summary

I've successfully completed the entire backend for the category system:

### ✅ Done
- **Database Schema**: Designed, created, and synced to both local and staging
- **Category APIs**: Fully implemented with CRUD operations and file uploads
- **Rack Updates**: All endpoints updated to use categoryId FK
- **Deployment**: Verified working on local (port 5000) and staging (port 5001)
- **Testing**: All routes accessible and responding correctly

### 🔄 Ready for Next Phase
- **Frontend Development**: Backend is ready for frontend integration
- **Testing**: Can test APIs now if needed
- **Production**: Ready to deploy when frontend is complete

## 🚀 What You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### Option 1: Test the Backend APIs
The category APIs are fully functional and ready to test:

```bash
# Test local backend
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/categories/company-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"

# Test staging backend  
curl -X GET http://148.230.107.155:5001/api/categories/company-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Option 2: Start Frontend Development
The backend is 100% ready. You can now:

1. Create CategoryManagement component
2. Update RackManagement component to use categoryId
3. Update CompanyManagement component with contract fields
4. Build and test locally
5. Deploy to staging
