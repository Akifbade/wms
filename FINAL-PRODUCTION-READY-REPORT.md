### 8. MINOR ISSUES FOUND (Non-Blocking)

#### Issue 1: Shipment Status Enum Naming
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** None (cosmetic)

**Fix:** Update schema comments to match code  
**Priority:** P3 - Can fix anytime  

#### Issue 2: Optional createdById Field
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Minor (audit trail incomplete)  
**Description:** Shipment.createdById is optional, should track who created  
**Fix:** Make required or set default to current user  
**Priority:** P2 - Fix in next update  

#### Issue 3: Missing Performance Indexes
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Negligible with current data size  
**Description:** shipments.status and shipment_boxes.status could use indexes  
**Fix:** Add indexes in Prisma schema  
**Priority:** P2 - Add when data grows
