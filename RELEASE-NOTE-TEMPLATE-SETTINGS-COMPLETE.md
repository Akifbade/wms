# Template Settings Applied to Release Notes - COMPLETE ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. ReleaseNoteModal.tsx - Template Settings Integration

#### Added Template Settings Interface
```typescript
interface TemplateSettings {
  companyName?: string;
  companyLogo?: string;
  companyAddress?: string;
  companyPhone?: string;
  companyEmail?: string;
  companyWebsite?: string;
  releaseNoteTitle?: string;
  releaseNoteShowLogo?: boolean;
  releaseShowShipment?: boolean;
  releaseShowStorage?: boolean;
  releaseShowItems?: boolean;
  releaseShowCollector?: boolean;
  releaseShowCharges?: boolean;
  releaseShowTerms?: boolean;
  releaseShowSignatures?: boolean;
  releaseTerms?: string;
  releaseFooterText?: string;
  releasePrimaryColor?: string;
  releaseNoteHeaderBg?: string;
  currencySymbol?: string;
  dateFormat?: string;
  timeFormat?: string;
}
```

#### Added Settings Fetch on Modal Open
- Fetches `/api/template-settings` when modal opens
- Stores in state using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Falls back to defaults if settings not available

#### Applied Settings to Rendering

**Header Section:**
- ✅ Company logo (from `companyLogo` setting)
- ✅ Company name (from `companyName`)
- ✅ Release note title (from `releaseNoteTitle`)
- ✅ Company address (from `companyAddress`)
- ✅ Company phone & email (from `companyPhone`, `companyEmail`)
- ✅ Primary color for heading (from `releasePrimaryColor`)
- ✅ Header background color (from `releaseNoteHeaderBg`)
- ✅ Show/hide logo toggle (from `releaseNoteShowLogo`)

**Date & Time Formatting:**
- ✅ Custom date format (from `dateFormat` - e.g., "MMM dd, yyyy", "dd/MM/yyyy")
- ✅ Custom time format (from `timeFormat` - e.g., "hh:mm a", "HH:mm")
- ✅ Applied to all date/time displays throughout document

**Currency:**
- ✅ Custom currency symbol (from `currencySymbol` - e.g., "KD", "$", "€")
- ✅ Applied to all amounts in charges section

**Section Visibility Toggles:**
- ✅ Shipment Details (controlled by `releaseShowShipment`)
- ✅ Storage Information (controlled by `releaseShowStorage`)
- ✅ Items Released (controlled by `releaseShowItems`)
- ✅ Collector Information (controlled by `releaseShowCollector`)
- ✅ Charges & Payment (controlled by `releaseShowCharges`)
- ✅ Terms & Conditions (controlled by `releaseShowTerms`)
- ✅ Authorization Signatures (controlled by `releaseShowSignatures`)

**Terms & Conditions:**
- ✅ Custom terms text (from `releaseTerms`)
- ✅ Falls back to default terms if not set

**Footer:**
- ✅ Custom footer text (from `releaseFooterText` - e.g., "Thank you for your business!")
- ✅ Company contact info from settings
- ✅ Website link (from `companyWebsite`)
- ✅ Colored border and text using theme colors

**Color Scheme:**
- ✅ All section headings use `releasePrimaryColor`
- ✅ Borders use `releaseNoteHeaderBg`
- ✅ Consistent color theme throughout document

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
```
User changes settings in Template Settings page
    ↓
Clicks "Save Settings"
    ↓
Settings saved to database
    ↓
User releases a shipment
    ↓
Release note modal opens
    ↓
Modal fetches template settings
    ↓
Release note renders with custom settings
```

### 2. Settings Priority
```
1. Custom settings from database (if exists)
2. Default values (if no custom settings)
3. Fallback hardcoded values (if API fails)
```

### 3. Example Settings Usage

**Before (Hardcoded):**
```tsx
<h1>QGO Cargo</h1>
<h2>SHIPMENT RELEASE NOTE</h2>
<span>5.000 KD</span>
```

**After (Template Settings):**
```tsx
<h1>{settings.companyName || 'QGO Cargo'}</h1>
<h2>{settings.releaseNoteTitle || 'SHIPMENT RELEASE NOTE'}</h2>
<span>{amount.toFixed(3)} {currency}</span>
```
