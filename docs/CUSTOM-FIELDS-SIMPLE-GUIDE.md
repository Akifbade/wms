# 🎓 CUSTOM FIELDS - SIMPLE EXPLANATION

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Imagine you run a warehouse. Different customers want to track different things:

- **Customer A** wants to track "Priority Level" (Low, Medium, High)
- **Customer B** wants to track "Insurance Value" (numbers)
- **Customer C** wants to track "Delivery Deadline" (dates)

Instead of hardcoding all these fields in the database, Custom Fields let each company create their own fields dynamically!

## Real-World Analogy

Think of Custom Fields like **Google Forms** but for your warehouse system:

```
Google Forms:                  Custom Fields:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You can add:                   You can add:
☐ Text Question                ☐ Text Field
☐ Multiple Choice              ☐ Dropdown Field
☐ Number Question              ☐ Number Field
☐ Date Question                ☐ Date Field
☐ Checkbox                     ☐ Checkbox Field

Then people fill them out      Then users fill them when
when taking your form          creating shipments/jobs
```

## How It Works (Simple Version)

### STEP 1: Admin Creates Field
```
Admin goes to: Settings → System Settings → Custom Fields
Clicks: [+ Add Field]
Fills form:
  Name: "Priority Level"
  Type: Dropdown
  Options: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
  Where to use: Shipment forms
Clicks: [Add Field]
```

### STEP 2: Field is Saved
```
Database stores:
┌────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ Field Name     │ Type     │ Section  │ Options             │
├────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Priority Level │ DROPDOWN │ SHIPMENT │ Low,Medium,High,... │
└────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### STEP 3: Workers See Field (Coming Soon)
```
When creating a new shipment, they see:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Create Shipment                 │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Name: ___________               │
│ Box Count: _____                │
│                                 │
│ ⭐ Priority Level:               │ ← Custom Field!
│ ▼ Select Priority               │
│   - Low                         │
│   - Medium                      │
│   - High                        │
│   - Urgent                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The 5 Field Types (Explained Simply)

### 1. TEXT - For Short Answers
```
Example: Special Instructions
User types: "Handle with care, fragile contents"
```

### 2. NUMBER - For Numeric Values
```
Example: Insurance Value
User types: 5000
System stores: 5000 (as number, can calculate totals)
```

### 3. DATE - For Dates
```
Example: Delivery Deadline
User picks: October 15, 2025
System stores: 2025-10-15
```

### 4. DROPDOWN - For Multiple Choice
```
Example: Priority Level
User selects: "High"
Options: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
```

### 5. CHECKBOX - For Yes/No

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q: Can I change a field after creating it?
**A:** Yes! Click the edit button ✏️, make changes, click "Update Field".

### Q: What happens if I delete a field?
**A:** It's a "soft delete" - the field is hidden but data remains in the database. You can't accidentally lose data!

### Q: Can two companies have fields with the same name?
**A:** Yes! Each company's fields are completely separate (multi-tenant isolation).

### Q: How many fields can I create?
**A:** No limit! But we recommend 5-10 per section for best user experience.

### Q: Can I reuse fields across sections?
**A:** No, each field is specific to one section (SHIPMENT, JOB, or EXPENSE). But you can create similar fields in multiple sections.

### Q: What's the difference between TEXT and DROPDOWN?
**A:** 
- TEXT: Users can type anything (freeform)
- DROPDOWN: Users must choose from pre-defined options (controlled)

### Q: Can I add more options to a dropdown later?
**A:** Yes! Click edit ✏️, add new options to the list, click "Update Field".

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use DROPDOWN for limited choices (Priority, Status, Category)
- Use TEXT for unique information (Instructions, Notes)
- Use NUMBER for values you might want to calculate (Insurance, Value)
- Use templates to save time
- Keep field names short and clear ("Priority" not "Priority Level Value")

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't create too many fields (overwhelms users)
- Don't use TEXT when DROPDOWN would work (harder to filter/report)
- Don't create duplicate fields (use edit instead)
- Don't delete fields unless absolutely necessary
