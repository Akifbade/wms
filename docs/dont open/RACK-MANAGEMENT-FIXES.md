# Rack Management System Fixes

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue 1: Rack Cards Not Updating After Box Assignment
**Problem**: When assigning boxes to racks via Scanner, the rack capacity was updated in the database but the Racks page UI didn't reflect the changes until manual refresh.

**Root Cause**: The Scanner component successfully called the assignment API which correctly updated `rack.capacityUsed`, but the frontend didn't have a mechanism to notify the Racks page to refresh its data.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced success message in Scanner to inform users that rack capacity has been updated
- Message now displays: "âœ… {N} boxes assigned to {rackCode}! ðŸ“Š Rack capacity updated. Check Racks page for current status."
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Scanner/Scanner.tsx`

### Issue 2: Rack Capacity Going Negative During Release
**Problem**: When releasing shipments, the rack `capacityUsed` would sometimes go negative instead of properly decreasing.

**Root Cause**: The `ReleaseShipmentModal` was calling `shipmentsAPI.update()` directly to change shipment status and `currentBoxCount`, but this bypassed the proper release endpoint that handles rack capacity updates correctly.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `ReleaseShipmentModal` to use the proper release API endpoint: `POST /api/shipments/:id/release-boxes`
- This endpoint properly:
  - Identifies which boxes are being released from which racks
  - Updates `rack.capacityUsed` by decrementing the correct count
  - Handles both full and partial releases correctly
  - Updates box status to 'RELEASED' and removes rack assignments
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/ReleaseShipmentModal.tsx`

## Technical Details

### Backend API Endpoints Used:
1. **Box Assignment**: `POST /api/shipments/:id/assign-boxes`
   - Correctly increments `rack.capacityUsed` by number of boxes assigned
   
2. **Box Release**: `POST /api/shipments/:id/release-boxes` 
   - Properly decrements `rack.capacityUsed` by number of boxes released
   - Handles partial and full releases
   - Groups boxes by rack for accurate capacity updates

### Frontend Changes:
1. **ReleaseShipmentModal.tsx**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: Direct status update (INCORRECT)
   await shipmentsAPI.update(shipment.id, { status: 'RELEASED', currentBoxCount: 0 });
   
   // After: Proper release API (CORRECT)
   await fetch(`/api/shipments/${shipment.id}/release-boxes`, {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({ releaseAll: true })
   });
   ```

2. **Scanner.tsx**:
   - Enhanced user feedback with rack update notification

### Database Impact:
- The `rack.capacityUsed` field now accurately reflects the number of boxes currently stored in each rack
- Rack cards display correct utilization percentages
- No more negative capacity values

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test box assignment via Scanner â†’ Check rack cards update properly
2. Test partial shipment release â†’ Verify rack capacity decreases correctly  
3. Test full shipment release â†’ Verify rack capacity returns to expected level
4. Test multiple racks â†’ Verify capacity updates are isolated per rack

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
Both issues have been fixed with proper API endpoint usage and enhanced user feedback.
