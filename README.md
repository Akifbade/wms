## ✅ How to Verify Material & Damage Workflow Locally

1. Start the app: `npm run dev` from the repository root.
2. Create a moving job via UI and optionally select materials while creating the job.
3. Issue materials to the job from Job Details -> Materials tab or during job creation.
4. When the job is complete, open Return Materials modal and record returned good and damaged quantities; attach photos for damaged items.
5. Go to Materials -> Reports and select the 'Damages' tab to view a consolidated damage report with thumbnails, reasons, job codes and estimated losses.
6. Open any job and click 'Report' to view job-level material usage, returns, and damage breakdown.
7. Use the CSV / Print buttons in the UI to export or print reports for audits.

If you find issues, check the backend logs and ensure the endpoints `/api/materials/issues` and `/api/materials/returns` are being called successfully.
