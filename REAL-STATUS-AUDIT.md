## 🚀 SHIPMENT & RACK SYSTEM MAJOR UPGRADE - October 13, 2025

### Problem: Shipments & Racks Not Well Integrated

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ❌ Released shipments mixed with active ones (confusing)
2. ❌ Released shipments still showing in rack views
3. ❌ No clear status separation
4. ❌ Partial release workflow unclear
5. ❌ Rack capacity impact not visible during release

**Solution: Complete Workflow Redesign**

### ✅ Part 1: Status-Based Tab System

**Shipments Page Now Has 4 Tabs**:

| Tab | Icon | Status | Badge Color | Purpose |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **All Shipments** | 📦 | All statuses | Gray | Complete overview |
| **Pending** | 🟡 | PENDING, IN_TRANSIT | Yellow | Not yet in storage |
| **In Storage** | 🟢 | IN_STORAGE | Green | Currently in racks |
| **Released** | 🔵 | RELEASED | Blue | Delivered/completed |

**Features**:
- Real-time count badges on each tab
- Click tab to filter instantly
- Search works across all tabs
- Status badges with emojis for quick recognition

**User Experience**:
```
Before: All shipments mixed together → confusing
After: Clear separation → easy to find what you need
```

### ✅ Part 2: Enhanced Release Modal

**New Rack Information Section** (prominently displayed):

```
📦 Current Status
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Current     │ Assigned    │ Rack        │ After       │
│ Stock       │ Rack        │ Location    │ Release     │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ 50 boxes    │ A1          │ Zone 1      │ 0 boxes ✓   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

Rack Capacity Impact:
[████████░░░░░░░░░░] 45/100
✓ Will free 50 units of space
```

**Full vs Partial Release**:
- **Full Release**: One click → all boxes released → rack emptied → status = RELEASED
- **Partial Release**: Select count → some boxes released → remaining stay in rack → status stays IN_STORAGE (until all released)

**Capacity Preview**:
- Shows current rack utilization
- Shows how much space will be freed
- Updates dynamically as you change release quantity
- Color-coded capacity bar (Green/Yellow/Red)

### ✅ Part 3: Rack Integration Improvements

**Backend Changes**:

1. **GET `/api/racks`** - Shipment counts now filter by `status: 'IN_STORAGE'`
   ```typescript
   _count: {
     select: {
       shipments: { where: { status: 'IN_STORAGE' } }  // Excludes RELEASED
     }
   }
   ```

2. **GET `/api/racks/:id`** - Shipment list now filters by `status: 'IN_STORAGE'`
   ```typescript
   shipments: {
     where: { status: 'IN_STORAGE' }  // Only active inventory
   }
   ```

**Result**:
- Released shipments **disappear** from rack views instantly
- Rack capacity shows only **active** inventory
- No more "ghost shipments" in racks
- Accurate space calculations

### ✅ Part 4: Status Flow & Visual Indicators

**Complete Shipment Lifecycle**:

```
1. CREATE SHIPMENT
   └─> Status: PENDING 🟡
       └─> Shows in "Pending" tab
       └─> Not assigned to rack yet

2. ASSIGN TO RACK (via Scanner or Create modal)
   └─> Status: IN_STORAGE 🟢
       └─> Shows in "In Storage" tab
       └─> Appears in rack view
       └─> Rack capacity increases

3. RELEASE SHIPMENT
   ├─> FULL RELEASE
   │   └─> Status: RELEASED 🔵
   │       └─> Shows in "Released" tab
   │       └─> Removed from rack view
   │       └─> Rack capacity decreases to 0
   │       └─> rackId cleared
   │
   └─> PARTIAL RELEASE
       └─> Status: IN_STORAGE 🟢 (still has boxes)
           └─> Stays in "In Storage" tab
           └─> Stays in rack view
           └─> Rack capacity decreases by released amount
           └─> When last box released → Status: RELEASED 🔵
```

### 🎯 Benefits of Upgrade

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Status Clarity** | Mixed together | Separate tabs with counts |
| **Released Items** | Still showing in racks | Hidden from rack views |
| **Partial Release** | Unclear | Clear preview & accurate tracking |
| **Rack Capacity** | No visibility | Real-time impact shown |
| **Status Badges** | Plain text | Color-coded with emojis |
| **User Workflow** | Confusing | Intuitive and visual |

### 📊 Technical Impact

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Shipments/Shipments.tsx` - Added tabs, status filtering, enhanced badges
- `frontend/src/components/ReleaseShipmentModal.tsx` - Added rack info section, capacity preview
- `backend/src/routes/racks.ts` - Filter IN_STORAGE only, exclude RELEASED

**Lines Changed**: ~150 lines
**Features Added**: 4 status tabs, rack info display, capacity visualization
**Bug Fixes**: Released shipments no longer appear in racks

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create shipment → appears in "Pending" tab
- [ ] Assign to rack → moves to "In Storage" tab
- [ ] Full release → moves to "Released" tab
- [ ] Full release → disappears from rack view
- [ ] Partial release (20/50 boxes) → stays in "In Storage" tab
- [ ] Partial release → rack capacity decreases by 20
- [ ] Release remaining boxes → moves to "Released" tab
- [ ] Released shipments not in rack shipment count
- [ ] Tab counts update in real-time
- [ ] Search works in all tabs

## ✨ CUSTOM FIELD VALUES IMPLEMENTATION - October 12, 2025

### Feature: Custom Fields Are Now Fully Functional! 🎉

**Problem Solved**: Custom fields were defined in Settings but couldn't actually be used in forms  
**Solution**: Implemented full custom field values system

### What Was Added:

#### 1. Database Model - `CustomFieldValue`
- Stores actual custom field data for any entity (Shipment, Job, Expense)
- Links to `CustomField` definition
- Stores `entityType` and `entityId` for flexible entity association
- Cascade delete when custom field definition is removed

**Schema**:
```prisma
model CustomFieldValue {
  id            String   @id
  customFieldId String
  entityType    String   // SHIPMENT, JOB, EXPENSE
  entityId      String   // ID of the shipment/job/expense
  fieldValue    String   // Stored as string, converted based on fieldType
  companyId     String
  customField   CustomField @relation(...)
  @@unique([customFieldId, entityId])
}
```

#### 2. Backend API - `/api/custom-field-values`
- **GET** `/:entityType/:entityId` - Load custom field values for an entity
- **POST** `/:entityType/:entityId` - Save/update custom field values (bulk operation)
- **DELETE** `/:id` - Delete a specific custom field value

#### 3. Frontend Integration - Shipment Modals

**CreateShipmentModal.tsx** enhanced with:
- Loads active SHIPMENT custom fields on modal open
- Renders dynamic form inputs based on field type:
  * TEXT → text input
  * NUMBER → number input
  * DATE → date picker
  * DROPDOWN → select with options from JSON
  * CHECKBOX → checkbox input
- Required field validation with red asterisk
- Saves custom field values after shipment creation
- Resets custom field values when modal closes

**EditShipmentModal.tsx** enhanced with:
- Loads custom field definitions for SHIPMENT section
- Loads existing values for the shipment being edited
- Pre-fills custom field inputs with saved values
- Updates custom field values when shipment is updated
- Same dynamic rendering as Create modal

### How It Works:

1. **Admin creates custom field** in Settings → System Settings → Custom Fields
2. **Field appears automatically** in Create/Edit Shipment modals
3. **User fills in custom field** when creating/editing shipment
4. **Values are saved** to database via `/api/custom-field-values` endpoint
5. **Values persist** and can be viewed/edited later

### Field Type Rendering:

- **TEXT**: Standard text input with placeholder
- **NUMBER**: Number input with validation
- **DATE**: Date picker (HTML5 date input)
- **DROPDOWN**: Select dropdown with options from field definition
- **CHECKBOX**: Checkbox with "Yes" label (stored as "true"/"false" string)

### Security:

- All endpoints protected with `authenticateToken` middleware
- CompanyId isolation ensures multi-tenant data separation
- Values associated with correct entity type and ID

### Status:

✅ **SHIPMENT custom fields**: Fully implemented (Create + Edit modals)  
⏳ **JOB custom fields**: Pending implementation  
⏳ **EXPENSE custom fields**: Pending implementation

### Next Steps:

1. Add custom fields to CreateMovingJobModal
2. Add custom fields to EditMovingJobModal
3. Add custom fields to CreateExpenseModal
4. Add custom fields to EditExpenseModal
5. Display custom field values in list/detail views

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXES - October 12, 2025

### Bug Fix #1: Shipment Release Not Clearing from Rack ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Released shipments remained assigned to racks after release  
**Impact**: Racks showed incorrect capacity (e.g., 75/100 instead of 50/100)  
**Root Cause**: PUT `/api/shipments/:id` only updated shipment record, didn't touch rack  
**Solution**: Enhanced shipment update route to:
- Detect `status === 'RELEASED'`
- Clear `rackId` (set to null)
- Set `releasedAt` timestamp
- Calculate boxes being released
- Update `rack.capacityUsed` (decrement by released boxes)
- Handle both full and partial releases

**File Modified**: `backend/src/routes/shipments.ts` (PUT /:id endpoint)  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed - Ready for testing

### Bug Fix #2: Custom Fields Not Appearing After Creation ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Added custom fields invisible in UI after creation  
**Impact**: Users thought field wasn't created, tried multiple times  
**Root Cause**: Manual state transformation didn't match backend response format  
**Solution**: Changed to reload data from server:
- Replaced manual state update with `await loadData()`
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added success alert messages
- Applied to both `handleAddCustomField()` and `handleUpdateField()`

**File Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Settings/components/SystemSettings.tsx`  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed - Ready for testing
