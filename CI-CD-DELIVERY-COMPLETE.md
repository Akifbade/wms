## 🚀 3-Stage Pipeline

```
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT    →    STAGING (VPS)    →    PRODUCTION (VPS)
    (develop)          (staging branch)         (main branch)
        ↓                   ↓                        ↓
   Create PR          Auto-Deploy            Manual Approval
   Run Tests          Test Features           Then Deploy
   Build Image        Verify Works            Run Health Check
                      If OK → PR to main      Auto-Rollback if fail
```

## 📋 Setup Required (You Do This)

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets (10 minutes)
Go to: `GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`

Add these secrets:
```
STAGING_VPS_HOST       = your-vps-ip
STAGING_VPS_USER       = staging-user
STAGING_VPS_SSH_KEY    = your-ssh-private-key
STAGING_VPS_PORT       = 22

PROD_VPS_HOST          = your-vps-ip
PROD_VPS_USER          = root
PROD_VPS_SSH_KEY       = your-ssh-private-key
PROD_VPS_PORT          = 22
```

See: `GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` → Step 1

### 2. Setup Branch Protection (5 minutes)
Go to: `GitHub → Settings → Branches`

Create protection rules for: `main`, `staging`, `develop`

See: `GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` → Step 2

### 3. Verify SSH Access (10 minutes)
Test SSH connection to both VPS:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key root@your-vps-ip
```

See: `GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` → Step 4

### 4. Test the Pipeline (20 minutes)
Create a test PR and watch it deploy:

See: `GITHUB-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` → Step 5
