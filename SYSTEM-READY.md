cd backend
npx prisma studio
# Studio opens on http://localhost:5555
```

**OR use the PowerShell windows that should already be open! 🎉**

---

## 📊 WHAT'S WORKING NOW

### ✅ Backend (Fully Functional)

- **Racks**: Full CRUD, capacity tracking, utilization stats
- **Moving Jobs**: Full CRUD with worker assignments
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics from database
- **Multi-tenant**: Company isolation works
- **Rack-centric**: All operations update rack inventory

### ✅ Frontend (UI Ready)
- **Beautiful Interface**: Tailwind CSS styled
- **All Pages Built**: 7 main pages + 8 settings
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Routing**: React Router with navigation
- **API Service**: Ready to connect (just created!)

### 🔄 What's Next (To Connect Them)
- Replace mock data in pages with real API calls
- Add loading states
- Add error handling UI
- Test full workflow

---

## 🎬 NEXT STEPS TO MAKE IT FULLY INTERACTIVE

### Step 1: Update Login Page (5 minutes)
Connect `Login.tsx` to use `authAPI.login()` instead of mock login.

### Step 2: Update Dashboard (5 minutes)
Connect `Dashboard.tsx` to use `dashboardAPI.getStats()` for real data.

### Step 3: Update Shipments Page (10 minutes)
Connect `Shipments.tsx` to use `shipmentsAPI` for CRUD operations.

### Step 4: Update Other Pages (15 minutes)
- Connect Racks page to `racksAPI`
- Connect Moving Jobs to `jobsAPI`

**Total time to full integration: ~30-40 minutes!** 🚀
