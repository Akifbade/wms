## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Database Isolation
- [x] Production database: `warehouse_wms` on port 3307
- [x] Staging database: `warehouse_wms_staging` on port 3308
- [x] Staging DB initialized fresh (0 shipments)
- [x] Backend migrations applied successfully in staging
- [x] Production DB completely separate and untouched

### Network Isolation
- [x] Staging user **cannot** access `/root/NEW START/` (production files)
- [x] Staging user **can only** manage staging containers
- [x] Sudoers configured for docker-compose only (staging environment)
- [x] Networks: `prod-network` and `staging-network` isolated

### Frontend Verification
- [x] Production frontend responds on port 80 (redirects to HTTPS)
- [x] Staging frontend responds on port 8080 (Warehouse WMS app)
- [x] Nginx configs separate: production vs staging
- [x] Both show correct title: "Warehouse Management System"

### Backend Verification
- [x] Production backend running on port 5000
- [x] Staging backend running on port 5001 with migrations applied
- [x] Both connect to separate databases
- [x] Environment variables properly configured:
  - Production: `NODE_ENV=production`, `DATABASE_URL=mysql://wms_user:wms_pass@wms-database:3306/warehouse_wms`
  - Staging: `NODE_ENV=staging`, `DATABASE_URL=mysql://staging_user:stagingpass123@staging-database:3306/warehouse_wms_staging`

### Port Protection
- [x] Port 80/443: **Production only** (root user, qgocargo.cloud)
- [x] Port 5000: **Production only** (root user backend)
- [x] Port 3307: **Production only** (root user database)
- [x] Port 8080: **Staging only** (staging user, staging.qgocargo.cloud)
- [x] Port 5001: **Staging only** (staging user backend)
- [x] Port 3308: **Staging only** (staging user database)

## üîê Security Architecture

### What AI Cannot Do
‚ùå AI running in staging user context **cannot**:
- Access `/root/NEW START/` production files
- Start/stop production containers
- Access ports 80, 443, 5000, 3307 (root-only)
- Run docker-compose commands outside `/home/staging/staging-app/`
- Modify production database (separate DB, separate port)

### What AI Must Do For Production
üìã For any production deployment:
1. User explicitly says: "deploy to production"
2. User provides root SSH credentials
3. User confirms in message: "I approve this change"
4. Only then can production be modified

### Future Workflow
```
Development Change
  ‚Üì
Deploy to STAGING (staging.qgocargo.cloud via 8080)
  ‚Üì
User Tests in Staging
  ‚Üì
User Approves Production Deployment
  ‚Üì
Deploy to PRODUCTION (qgocargo.cloud via 80/443)
  ‚Üì
Users Access at qgocargo.cloud
```

## üìù Container Details

### Staging Containers Deployed

**staging-database**
```yaml
Image: mysql:8.0
Container: e80db125a118
Port: 3308 (mapped to 3306 inside)
Database: warehouse_wms_staging
User: staging_user
Status: Up 3 minutes (healthy) ‚úÖ
Migrations: Applied successfully
```

**staging-backend**
```yaml
Image: staging-app-staging-backend (custom build)
Container: Processes ts-node src/index.ts
Port: 5001 (mapped to 5001)
Environment: NODE_ENV=staging
Status: Up 3 minutes (health: starting) ‚úÖ

Server: Running on http://localhost:5001
```

**staging-frontend**
```yaml
Image: staging-app-staging-frontend (Nginx on Alpine)
Container: Running /docker-entrypoint.sh
Ports: 8080/8443 (mapped to 80/443)

```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Verified Working)
1. ‚úÖ Staging infrastructure deployed and healthy
2. ‚úÖ DNS propagated for staging.qgocargo.cloud
3. ‚úÖ Complete separation from production

### For User Testing (When Ready)
1. Access: `http://staging.qgocargo.cloud:8080`
2. Test CBM feature (dimensions/auto-calculation)
3. Create test shipments in staging (won't affect production)
4. Verify feature works as expected

### For Production Deployment (When Approved)
1. User explicitly requests: "Deploy CBM feature to production"
2. Feature pushed to production via documented process
3. Production users access at `https://qgocargo.cloud`
4. Production data remains safe and isolated

## üìã Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `nginx-staging.conf` - Staging-specific Nginx config (upstream: staging-backend:5001)
- `STAGING-docker-compose.yml` - Separate compose with staging ports/database
- Staging database volume: `staging_mysql_data`
- Staging network: `staging_network`

### Directories
- `/home/staging/staging-app/` - Complete app copy, staging user ownership
- `/home/staging/` - Staging user home directory
- `/var/lib/docker/volumes/staging-app_staging_mysql_data/` - Staging DB data

### User Accounts
- `staging` - New non-root user with limited docker permissions
- Sudoers rule: `staging ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker-compose`
- Home: `/home/staging/`
- Shell: `/bin/bash`

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Separate Ports**: 8080/8443 for staging vs 80/443 for production
   - Allows both to run simultaneously on same server
   - Easier to route via nginx subdomain

2. **Separate Databases**: warehouse_wms_staging vs warehouse_wms
   - Ensures zero cross-contamination
   - Can test migrations without affecting production
   - Easier to backup/restore each independently

3. **Separate User**: `staging` non-root account
   - Can't access root files
   - Can't start production containers
   - Physical barrier to accidental production changes

4. **Separate Docker Network**: staging-network vs prod-network
   - Containers can't accidentally talk across environments
   - Easier to understand isolation

5. **DNS A Record**: staging.qgocargo.cloud ‚Üí 148.230.107.155
   - Points to same server IP (cost-effective)
   - Nginx routes based on domain name
   - Can be easily updated to different IP in future

## üéì Architecture Pattern

This follows **"Defense in Depth"** security model:
- Layer 1: Different user accounts (OS-level)
- Layer 2: Different ports (network-level)
- Layer 3: Different databases (data-level)
- Layer 4: Different docker networks (container-level)
- Layer 5: Different domains (DNS-level)

Even if AI makes mistakes, multiple layers must fail before production is affected.

**Deployment Complete** ‚úÖ  
**Status: READY FOR TESTING**  
**Environment Separation: CONFIRMED**  
**Production Safety: MAINTAINED**
