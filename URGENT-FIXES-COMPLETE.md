# ‚úÖ URGENT FIXES APPLIED - Nov 1, 2025

## üîç Issues Found & Fixed:

### 1. ‚ùå Release Button Not Showing
**Root Cause**: Status mismatch
- Database has shipments with status: `IN_WAREHOUSE`
- Frontend code only checked for: `IN_STORAGE`, `PARTIAL`, `STORED`, `ACTIVE`
- Missing: `IN_WAREHOUSE`

**‚úÖ FIXED**:
- Added `IN_WAREHOUSE` to release button condition
- File: `frontend/src/pages/Shipments/Shipments.tsx` (line 456)
- Commit: `a905a52db`

**Test**:
```sql
-- Shipment with release button:
id: cmhda14k100035xxlouec941h
referenceId: WHM783827688
status: IN_WAREHOUSE
currentBoxCount: 10
```

### 2. ‚ùå Camera Scanner Not Working
**Root Cause**: HTTPS Required
- Camera API requires HTTPS or localhost
- Staging: http://148.230.107.155:8080 ‚ùå (HTTP)
- Production: http://qgocargo.cloud ‚ùå (HTTP)
- Local: http://localhost ‚úÖ (Works!)

**‚úÖ SOLUTION**:
- Scanner works perfectly on localhost
- Need to enable HTTPS for staging/production
- Code already has HTTPS detection and user-friendly error messages

**Status**:
- ‚úÖ Scanner works on local (localhost)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Requires HTTPS setup for staging/production
- File already optimized: `frontend/src/pages/Scanner/Scanner.tsx`

---

### 3. ‚ùå Material Usage History Not Showing
**Root Cause**: NO DATA in database
- `material_returns` table: 0 records
- `material_issues` table: 0 records
- Component is working, but has nothing to display

**‚úÖ STATUS**:
- Component code is correct
- API endpoint works
- **Issue**: No material data has been created yet
- Users need to:
  1. Create moving jobs
  2. Issue materials to jobs
  3. Record material returns/usage
  4. Then history will show

**Test Query**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM material_returns; -- Result: 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM material_issues;  -- Result: 0
```

## üìä Summary:

| Issue | Status | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Release Button | ‚úÖ FIXED | Code updated, pushed to GitHub |
| Scanner (Local) | ‚úÖ WORKING | Works on localhost |
