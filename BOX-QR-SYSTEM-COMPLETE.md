# ✅ Individual Box QR System - COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Individual Box Tracking**
- ✅ Each box now gets its own unique QR code
- ✅ Example: If shipment has 10 boxes, you get 10 QR codes
  - Master QR: `QR-SH-1728900000`
  - Box 1: `QR-SH-1728900000-BOX-1`
  - Box 2: `QR-SH-1728900000-BOX-2`
  - ... Box 10: `QR-SH-1728900000-BOX-10`

### 2. **Flexible Multi-Rack Assignment**
- ✅ Workers can split shipments across multiple racks
- ✅ Example workflow:
  ```
  Shipment: 10 boxes for Ahmed
  1. Create shipment → Assign 5 boxes to Rack A1
  2. Later: Assign 3 boxes to Rack B2 (via Scanner)
  3. Later: Assign 2 boxes to Rack C3 (via Scanner)
  Result: ✅ One shipment spread across 3 racks!
  ```

### 3. **Quantity Selector Everywhere**
- ✅ **CreateShipmentModal**: "How many boxes to assign?" input
- ✅ **Scanner**: Same quantity selector when scanning rack
- ✅ Both show remaining boxes available

### 4. **Box QR Codes Viewer**
- ✅ New modal to view all box QR codes for a shipment
- ✅ Click QR icon (📱) in Shipments table
- ✅ Shows grid of all boxes with their QR codes
- ✅ Print button to print all QR codes at once
- ✅ Color-coded status: Yellow (PENDING), Green (IN_STORAGE), Gray (RELEASED)
- ✅ Shows which rack each box is in

### 5. **Backend APIs**
- ✅ `POST /api/shipments` - Creates shipment + generates N box QR codes
- ✅ `GET /api/shipments/:id/boxes` - Returns all boxes with QR codes and locations
- ✅ `POST /api/shipments/:id/assign-boxes` - Assigns specific boxes to a rack
  - Body: `{ rackId: "xxx", boxNumbers: [1,2,3,4,5] }`

### 6. **Database Schema**
- ✅ New model: `ShipmentBox`
  - Individual tracking per box
  - Unique QR code per box
  - Separate rack assignment per box
  - Status tracking (PENDING/IN_STORAGE/RELEASED)
- ✅ Rack: Added `minCapacity` field (default: 2)
