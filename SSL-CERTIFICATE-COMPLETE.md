# SSL Certificate Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Domain: qgocargo.duckdns.org

### What Was Done

1. **Installed Certbot and Nginx Plugin**
   - Installed `certbot` and `python3-certbot-nginx` on the VPS
   - These tools manage SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt

2. **Updated Nginx Configuration**
   - Added `qgocargo.duckdns.org` as the primary server name
   - Kept `72.60.215.188` as alternate access
   - Updated both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) server blocks

3. **Obtained SSL Certificate**
   - Successfully obtained a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
   - Certificate location: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/qgocargo.duckdns.org/`
   - Certificate expires: **January 13, 2026** (90 days from issue)

4. **Configured Nginx to Use SSL Certificate**
   - Updated SSL certificate path to: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/qgocargo.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem`
   - Updated SSL private key path to: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/qgocargo.duckdns.org/privkey.pem`
   - Reloaded Nginx to apply changes

5. **Enabled Automatic Renewal**
   - Enabled `certbot-renew.timer` systemd service
   - Certificates will auto-renew before expiration
   - Next renewal check: Will run twice daily

## Certificate Management

### Manual Renewal (if needed)
```bash
ssh root@72.60.215.188
certbot renew
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Check Certificate Status
```bash
ssh root@72.60.215.188
certbot certificates
```

### Check Auto-Renewal Timer
```bash
ssh root@72.60.215.188
systemctl status certbot-renew.timer
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **DuckDNS Configuration**
   - Make sure your DuckDNS domain is properly configured to point to `72.60.215.188`
   - Visit https://www.duckdns.org to manage your domain

2. **Firewall**
   - Port 80 (HTTP) must be open for certificate renewal
   - Port 443 (HTTPS) must be open for secure access

3. **Certificate Expiration**
   - Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days
   - Auto-renewal will handle this automatically
   - You'll receive no renewal emails (registered without email)

4. **Renewal Process**
   - Certbot will attempt renewal twice daily
   - Actual renewal happens 30 days before expiration
   - Nginx will automatically reload after successful renewal

## Troubleshooting

### If SSL Warning Returns
1. Check certificate status:
   ```bash
   ssh root@72.60.215.188 "certbot certificates"
   ```

2. Manually renew:
   ```bash
   ssh root@72.60.215.188 "certbot renew --force-renewal"
   ```

3. Reload Nginx:
   ```bash
   ssh root@72.60.215.188 "systemctl reload nginx"
   ```

### If Domain Not Resolving
1. Check DuckDNS IP configuration
2. Verify DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org/
3. Update DuckDNS token if needed
