flightNumber  String? // Flight tracking
origin        String? // Origin location
destination   String? // Destination
customerName  String? // Normalized customer name for grouping
```

**New ShipmentItem Model:**
```prisma
model ShipmentItem {
  id               String   @id @default(cuid())
  shipmentId       String
  itemName         String   // e.g., "Louis Vuitton Bags"
  itemDescription  String?
  category         String   // BAGS, SHOES, ELECTRONICS, etc.

## 📊 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

**Database Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX "Shipment_category_idx" ON "Shipment"("category");
CREATE INDEX "Shipment_customerName_idx" ON "Shipment"("customerName");
CREATE INDEX "Shipment_awbNumber_idx" ON "Shipment"("awbNumber");
CREATE INDEX "ShipmentItem_shipmentId_idx" ON "ShipmentItem"("shipmentId");
CREATE INDEX "ShipmentItem_category_idx" ON "ShipmentItem"("category");
```

**Query Optimization:**
- Customer materials view: 1 query instead of N+1
- Worker pending: Filtered at database level
- Available racks: Single JOIN query

---

## 🔐 SECURITY FEATURES

**All routes protected with:**
- ✅ JWT authentication (`authenticateToken` middleware)
- ✅ Company isolation (all queries filtered by `companyId`)
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection (React sanitization)

**Example Validation:**
```typescript
const createItemSchema = z.object({
  itemName: z.string().min(1, 'Item name is required'),
  category: z.enum(['BAGS', 'SHOES', 'ELECTRONICS', ...]),
  quantity: z.number().int().positive('Quantity must be positive'),
  weight: z.number().positive().optional(),
  value: z.number().positive().optional(),
});
