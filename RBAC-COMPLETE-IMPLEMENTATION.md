- ✅ My Tasks - Daily task list

**Access:**

- ❌ Shipments (blocked)
- ❌ Racks (blocked)
- ❌ Invoices (blocked)
- ❌ Expenses (blocked)

**Auto-Redirect:**

- If worker tries any blocked route, redirects to `/scanner`

## 🛡️ Protection Levels

### Frontend Protection
**Navigation Filtering:**
- Each role sees only their allowed menu items
- Dynamic navigation based on `user.role`
- UI elements hidden based on permissions

**Route Protection:**
- `<ProtectedRoute>` component wraps sensitive routes
- Checks user role before rendering
- Auto-redirects unauthorized access

**Example:**
```tsx
<Route path="settings" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['ADMIN']}>
    <Settings />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Backend Protection
**Middleware:**
- `authenticateToken` - Verify JWT
- `authorizeRoles(['ADMIN'])` - Check role
- `requirePermission('users', 'create')` - Check specific permission

**Protected Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Admin only
router.post('/users', authorizeRoles('ADMIN'), ...)
router.delete('/users/:id', authorizeRoles('ADMIN'), ...)

// Admin & Manager
router.get('/shipments', authorizeRoles('ADMIN', 'MANAGER'), ...)

// All authenticated users
router.get('/profile/me', authenticateToken, ...)
```

## 🎯 Worker Workflow

### Worker Login → Auto-Redirect
1. Login with worker credentials
2. System checks role = 'WORKER'

**QR Scanner (`/scanner`):**
- Scan QR codes on items
- Verify item details
- Move items between racks
- Update inventory
- Real-time updates

**My Tasks (`/my-tasks`):**

- Completed tasks history
- Performance tracking

### Worker Restrictions
