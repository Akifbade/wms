## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **String vs Enum**: Using String types in Prisma for SQLite compatibility
2. **Incremental Calculations**: Metrics updated on each GPS point for performance
3. **Sanity Checks**: Max 500m jump between GPS points to filter errors
4. **Idle Detection**: 5 km/h threshold with 5-minute minimum
5. **Auto-End**: Trips auto-end after 20 minutes of no GPS updates
6. **Multi-tenancy**: All models include companyId for data isolation
7. **Feature Flag**: `FLEET_ENABLED` for gradual rollout
