# 💰 Payment-Before-Release System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Changed?

**OLD WORKFLOW** (Before):
```
Customer wants to collect goods
  ↓
Click withdraw/release
  ↓
Items released immediately
  ↓
Invoice created separately (maybe never)
  ❌ Problem: Items released without payment
```

**NEW WORKFLOW** (Now):
```
Customer wants to collect goods
  ↓
System creates invoice AUTOMATICALLY
  ↓
MUST PAY or MARK AS DEBT
  ↓
Record payment (Cash/KNET with transaction details)
  ↓
THEN release goods + print receipt
  ✅ Payment enforced before release!
```

## 🔥 Key Features

- Invoice status → PARTIAL
- Remaining balance tracked
- Goods still released (you decide policy)

#### 📝 **Option 3: On Debt**
- Customer takes goods without payment
- Invoice status → PENDING
- Balance due tracked
- Customer must pay later
- ⚠️ Use with trusted customers only

### 3. **Payment Methods Supported**
- **CASH** - Direct cash payment
- **KNET** - Card payment (requires transaction reference number)
- **BANK_TRANSFER** - Bank transfer
