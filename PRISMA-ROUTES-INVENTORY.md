// 3. Update boxes: status=IN_STORAGE, rackId, assignedAt
// 4. Update rack: capacityUsed += boxCount
// 5. Update shipment: if all assigned ‚Üí status=ACTIVE, else status=PARTIAL

## Build Order (Priority)

1. **CRITICAL (production blocker):**
   - Warehouse intake
   - Assign boxes to rack
   - Pending list
   - Release boxes
   
2. **HIGH (features staff use daily):**
   - Moving jobs (full CRUD + assignments)
   - Material issue/return/approve
   - Invoice creation + payment

3. **MEDIUM (operational):**
   - Reports
   - Settings
   - Custom fields

4. **LOW (nice to have):**
   - Advanced filters
   - Batch operations
   - Analytics

---

## Testing Each Endpoint

**Template (repeat for each endpoint):**

```bash
# 1. Get token
$token = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login `
  -Method POST -Body (@{email='qa@example.com'; password='StrongPass123'} | ConvertTo-Json) `
  -ContentType application/json).token

# 2. Test endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/... `
  -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $token"} `
  -Method POST -Body ... -ContentType application/json

# 3. Verify response matches Prisma behavior
```

---

## Git Workflow for Each Endpoint

```bash
# Create endpoint
vim backend/src/routes-parse/warehouse.ts

# Test locally
docker-compose restart backend
# Test with PowerShell/Postman

# If working:
git add backend/src/routes-parse/warehouse.ts
git commit -m "Parse: Add warehouse intake endpoint"

# If broken:
git checkout BACKUP-PRISMA-MYSQL/backend/src/routes/warehouse.ts
# Copy reference code
# Edit Parse version again
# Retry
```

**Start with the CRITICAL section. That's what blocks your team from working.**
