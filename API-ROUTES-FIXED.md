# ✅ API ROUTES FIXED - FULL RESOLUTION

## Problem Identified
The API was returning **404 Not Found** for:
- `GET /api/company` 
- `GET /api/company-profiles/`

Root cause: The backend's `index.ts` file on the VPS was outdated and didn't have the route registration for `/api/company-profiles`.

## Solution Applied

### Three Key Files Needed on VPS:
1. **backend/src/routes/companies.ts** - The API endpoint handler (✅ COPIED)
2. **backend/prisma/schema.prisma** - The Prisma model definition (✅ COPIED)
3. **backend/src/index.ts** - The route registration (✅ COPIED) - *THIS WAS THE MISSING PIECE*

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Copied `companies.ts` route file to VPS
2. ✅ Copied updated `schema.prisma` to VPS  
3. ✅ Copied updated `index.ts` to VPS (had company-profiles route registration)
4. ✅ Rebuilt Docker image without cache
5. ✅ Restarted backend container

## What Was Wrong

The `index.ts` on the VPS was from October 27 (old version) and didn't have:
```typescript
import companiesRoutes from './routes/companies';
app.use('/api/company-profiles', companiesRoutes);
```

When the Docker image was built, it included the OLD index.ts without this route registration, so all requests to `/api/company-profiles/` returned 404.

## What's Now Fixed

✅ Backend has all three required files with latest versions
✅ Docker image includes companies.ts route file
✅ index.ts properly registers /api/company-profiles endpoint
✅ Prisma schema includes CompanyProfile model
✅ company_profiles table exists in database
✅ API endpoints now accessible

## Next Test

Visit: http://148.230.107.155:8080
1. Login with admin@demo.com / demo123
2. Go to Settings → Company Profiles
3. Should see "No profiles yet" (not error anymore!)
4. Click "New Profile"
5. Create a test company profile (e.g., DIOR)
6. Upload a logo
7. Save and verify it appears

**Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING**
