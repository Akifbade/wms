## 🔧 WHAT WAS BROKEN & NOW FIXED

### PRIMARY ISSUE: Empty Permissions Tables ❌ → ✅

**Root Cause:**
- `permissions` table was empty (0 rows)
- `role_permissions` table was empty (0 rows)
- This broke ALL permission-based features

**Impact:**
- ❌ Role Management couldn't load (no permissions to display)
- ❌ Permission checks failing silently
- ❌ Features requiring specific permissions wouldn't work

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Uploaded and ran seed-permissions.ts script
ssh root@72.60.215.188 "cd /var/www/wms/backend && npx ts-node prisma/seed-permissions.ts"
```

**Result:** ✅ FIXED
- ✅ 84 permissions created (12 resources × 7 actions)
- ✅ ADMIN role: 84 permissions (full access)
- ✅ MANAGER role: 29 permissions
- ✅ WORKER role: 10 permissions
- ✅ All assigned to existing company

4. Look for errors:
   - Red error messages
   - Failed API calls (404, 403, 500)
   - JavaScript exceptions
```

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
```
1. Press F12

pm2 logs wms-backend --lines 100

# Watch live logs while testing
pm2 logs wms-backend
```

### Step 4: Test API Directly
```bash
# Get auth token
ssh root@72.60.215.188
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@demo.com","password":"admin123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Test specific endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/users | jq
